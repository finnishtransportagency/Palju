- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) package manager

Go to the project root and install dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

Start the development server

The application should open to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Create a production build

Run one of the following scripts depending on the target environment.
